                        <p>
                            The farm my parents started in the 1970s was part of the early movement of people who wanted to see food grown in a different way. They cared about reducing food miles, connecting with their customers, providing a healthy work environment, promoting biodiversity and growing varieties of crops that tasted better while operating an environmentally and economically sustainable farming system. Today’s organic standard does not certify for these items, but we are steadfast in keeping our farming practices true to our parents’ vision for a better food system. It's what we call "beyond organic."

                            Our farm is certified organic by CCOF. We are proud to have the client code of Yo02 (Yolo 2) – the second organic farm ever certified in Yolo County by CCOF.

                            Today, at our second-generation family farm, Capay Organic, we keep with our parents’ vision by practicing healthy crop rotation, encouraging a diverse ecosystem around the fields, efficiently using local water sources and carefully selecting produce varieties that grow well and taste great.
